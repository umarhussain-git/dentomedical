Description: 
    The 'dentomedical' package provides a comprehensive suite of tools for 
    medical, dental, and clinical research analytics. It offers automated 
    descriptive statistics, normality assessment, and bivariate analysis with 
    intelligent test selection tailored to variable type and study design. 
    The package also delivers clean, structured, and publication-ready summary 
    tables using 'flextable', ensuring that results are clear, reproducible, 
    and suitable for manuscripts and reports. Built upon the tidy principles of 
    'dplyr' and 'tidyr', 'dentomedical' streamlines data handling and enhances 
    the efficiency of quantitative research workflows.
